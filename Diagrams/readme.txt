Employee-Task-Management
In this project, we'll create a Web-App based Employee Task Assignment management. This is a very common problem in companies that an employee already working on an assigned task and another mentor or boss going to assign him a new task, S/He might not know that employeeâ€™s availability and the priority of the task on which employee already working. In that scenario, there will be lots of communication going around to assign the task, due to which task going to be a delay. To resolve these issues and make employee availability transparent, we need to make a system in which mentors can assign tasks to the employee and other mentors can monitor the availability of employees and on that basis, they can assign him/her new task. As well as employee can see all the assign task with priorities. The app should be able to: Store data on new Employee/Trainee/Intern and new Task Assignments Employees can see the availability of other employees, trainees, and interns but trainee and intern will not able to see other availability Employees can assign task with details like task name, task description, assigner, priority, expected hours for completion [can be modified by both assignor and assignee] to other employee's, trainee's or intern's ToDo list If total hours of working for an employee is 8 then task assignor will see the warning about employee does not any bandwidth for assignment date An employee can see his/her task and mark them as InProgress/Done/Submitted.
